    To use these file you could either drag the file you need to what
    ever the target directory and run it.
    
    I will strongly suggest setup your path to one specific directory 
    what ever you like to place and put all the files to that directoy, 
    so you can just run it everywhere(any directory) and it will still 
    work.
